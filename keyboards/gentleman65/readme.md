The Gentleman 65 combines the sleek look of natural wood, with the fun of frosted acrylic to produce a truly unique look that differs from existing boards on the market. The board consists of 2 3mm frosted acrylic layers, topped by 2 layers of 6mm of wood, a frosted acrylic wedge, and 2 feet that give the board an angle of 7Â°. The board is unique in its inclusion of a top mounting system, something rarely seen on the laser cut board.
